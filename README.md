# MinesweeperForBCSE102L
A simple minesweeper code made for the DA of the theory component of our Structured and Object-Oriented Programming course.

To customize difficulty, the (square) board's side length and number of mines can be set in the main file. The code WILL break if you mess around with a weird or impossible number of mines with the set side length. Obviously. 
This project idea was found on GeeksforGeeks at (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-cpp-project-ideas-for-beginners-advanced/) under the Intermediate Difficulty. We follow a algorithm similar to the one found on the same site.
